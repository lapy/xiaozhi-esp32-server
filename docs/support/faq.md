# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

Get answers to the most common questions about Xiaozhi ESP32 Server based on real user experiences and issues.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Q: Why does Xiaozhi recognize multiple languages when I speak? üåç**

**Suggestion:** Check if the `models` directory has model files. If not, download them from the [Deployment Guide](../installation/docker.md#model-files).

This usually happens when:
- No ASR model files are present
- Using a multilingual model without language specification
- Model files are corrupted or incomplete

**Solution:**
1. Download the appropriate Vosk English model
2. Ensure model files are in the correct directory structure
3. Verify model configuration in `.config.yaml`

### **Q: Why does the error "TTS task failed: file not found" occur? üìÅ**

**Suggestion:** Check if you have installed `libopus` and `ffmpeg` using `conda`. If not, install them.

**Common causes:**
- Missing audio codec libraries
- Incorrect file paths in configuration
- Permission issues with temporary files

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install required dependencies
conda install libopus -y
conda install ffmpeg -y

# Or using pip
pip install ffmpeg-python
```

### **Q: Why does TTS often fail and timeout? ‚è∞**

**Suggestion:** If TTS often fails, please check if you are using a proxy. If so, try disabling the proxy and retrying.

**Common causes:**
- Network proxy interference
- Slow internet connection
- TTS service rate limits
- Firewall blocking requests

**Solutions:**
1. **Disable proxy** for TTS services
2. **Use local TTS** (EdgeTTS) instead of cloud services
3. **Check network connectivity** to TTS providers
4. **Increase timeout values** in configuration

### **Q: Why can't I connect to the self-built server using 4G mode? üîê**

**Reason:** The firmware of the ESP32 board requires a secure connection in 4G mode.

**Solution:** There are two ways to solve this problem:

1. **Modify the code** to use a secure connection
2. **Use nginx** to configure an SSL certificate

For detailed instructions, refer to the project documentation or GitHub issues.

### **Q: How can I improve Xiaozhi's conversation response speed? ‚ö°**

**Suggestion:** The default configuration of this project is a low-cost solution. We recommend that beginners use the default free model to solve the "running" problem first, and then optimize the "running fast" problem.

**Performance Optimization Table:**

| Module Name | Default Free Configuration | Streaming Configuration |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ASR (Speech Recognition) | OpenaiASR (API) or **WhisperASR (Local)** | üëçOpenaiASR (API) or üëçGroqASR (API) or **üëçWhisperASR (Local)** |
| LLM (Large Model) | OpenAILLM (OpenAI gpt-4o-mini) | üëçLMStudioLLM (Local llama3.1:8b) |
| VLLM (Visual Large Model) | OpenAILLMVLLM (OpenAI gpt-4o) | üëçOpenAILLMVLLM (OpenAI gpt-4o) |
| TTS (Text-to-Speech) | ‚úÖEdgeTTS (Microsoft Edge TTS) | üëçOpenAITTS (OpenAI TTS) |
| Intent (Intent Recognition) | function_call (Function Call) | function_call (Function Call) |
| Memory (Memory Function) | mem_local_short (Local Short-term Memory) | mem_local_short (Local Short-term Memory) |

**Streaming Configuration Benefits:**
- Improves response speed by about **2.5 seconds** compared to early versions
- Enables real-time processing
- Reduces overall latency

### **Q: Why does Xiaozhi often interrupt when I speak slowly with pauses? üó£Ô∏è**

**Suggestion:** In the configuration file, find the following part and increase the value of `min_silence_duration_ms` (e.g., to `1000`):

```yaml
VAD:
  SileroVAD:
    threshold: 0.5
    model_dir: models/snakers4_silero-vad
    min_silence_duration_ms: 700  # If you speak slowly, you can increase this value
```

**Configuration Options:**
- **Increase `min_silence_duration_ms`** to 1000-1500ms for slow speakers
- **Adjust `threshold`** to be less sensitive (0.3-0.4)
- **Enable `pre_padding_ms`** and `post_padding_ms` for better detection

## üîß Technical Issues

### **Q: Can I connect to self-built server using WiFi, but 4G mode cannot connect?**

**Reason:** 4G mode requires secure connections (HTTPS/WSS) while WiFi allows HTTP/WS.

**Solutions:**
1. **Configure SSL certificates** for your server
2. **Use nginx reverse proxy** with SSL termination
3. **Modify ESP32 firmware** to support secure connections
4. **Use domain name** instead of IP address

### **Q: I want to control lights, air conditioning, remote power on/off through Xiaozhi**

**Solution:** Integrate with HomeAssistant using the built-in function calling capabilities.

**Steps:**
1. **Set up HomeAssistant** with your smart devices
2. **Configure Xiaozhi** to use function calling
3. **Add HomeAssistant integration** in agent configuration
4. **Test voice commands** like "Turn on the living room light"

See the [HomeAssistant Integration Guide](../guides/homeassistant.md) for detailed instructions.

## üé§ Speech Recognition Issues

### **Q: How to use Whisper ASR for offline speech recognition? üé§**

**Whisper ASR** is a powerful offline speech recognition solution that provides excellent accuracy for multilingual speech recognition.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
ASR:
  WhisperASR:
    type: whisper
    model_name: base  # Choose from: tiny, base, small, medium, large-v1, large-v2, large-v3
    device: auto      # auto, cpu, cuda
    language: null    # null for auto-detect, or specific language code
    output_dir: tmp/
```

**Key Features:**
- **Offline Operation**: Complete offline after initial model download
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports 99+ languages with auto-detection
