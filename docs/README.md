## ⚠️ Important Note

This is a Western adaptation of the original [xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-esp32-server](https://github.com/xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-esp32-server) project. All credits for the original excellent work go to the xinnan-tech team. This port removes Chinese AI providers and infrastructure dependencies, replacing them with Western alternatives while preserving the core architecture and functionality.

*Happy building! 🚀*
